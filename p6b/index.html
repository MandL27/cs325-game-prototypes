<h2>Dot Matrix 2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Unlike maze games that require the player to evade enemies while collecting items, Dot Matrix pits players against each other in a race to collect the most dots first.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Phaser's physics engine is only used for detecting overlap. Depenetration and movement are handled entirely through my own code. Additionally, input is only polled when pieces are fully within grid cells, ensuring movement stays grid-aligned.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
After the false start of trying to use a tilemap, I realized that my hacky approach from Drag Race (where I added a bunch of rectangular walls procedurally) was actually easier to implement, and I used it for Dot Matrix as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Everything was drawn by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This iteration of Dot Matrix adds four-player support, a larger maze, and removes(!) player collision. When playtesting, I found that having player collision disabled was more fun than the alternative, which is reflected here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Race through a maze to get the most dots.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is a nearly-complete implementation of the game as I see it. I didn't add enemies, which are the only remaining thing I can think of to add in the future.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Dot Matrix is designed to lead players to outwit and outmaneuver each other. While blockades aren't possible in this version, I feel this will place even more emphasis on efficient routing to clean out the maze with as little residue as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Input is entirely handled with a keyboard. Player one (blue) uses WSAD to move, while player two (orange) uses the arrow keys. Dots are collected as players pass over them, but scores are hidden until the end. If a player attempts to turn toward a wall, they stop moving and must push a button to resume movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Camping the fastest route, which was prevalent during physical prototyping, is no longer possible, so efficient routing is more important than ever in avoiding giving your opponents any room to close the gap.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is purely abstract and gameplay-oriented. Game pieces serve no purpose other than representing players and the objects they must collect.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Dot Matrix is aimed at players who want a competitive twist on classic maze game action.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
In its current state, the game takes no more than two minutes to play.
</li>
