<h2>Coin Sniper</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Unlike some "click the objects that appear" games, this one continually adds "hazard" circles that end the game once clicked, creating a bullet hell feel.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
True to the challenge I chose to use, no objects are ever destroyed over the course of play. Coins move after being clicked, and every coin click spawns a new hazard.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that click-and-drag support in Phaser is sketchy at best, forcing me to abandon the old idea I had in favor of something simpler and easier to implement. Setting up randomized position and direction was easy, but getting screen wrap was a workaround for bouncing off the screen bounds not working as I wanted.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Red and yellow circles "drawn" by me</li>
<li>velocityFromAngle for getting angle vectors idea from <a href="https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/fire-bullets-from-facing-direction-phaser-3/">here</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game is nearest to "clicker"-type idle games early on, but as the game progresses it starts to resemble bullet hell games like Touhou. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Click coins and avoid red dots.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Things must only be added as the game progresses, not removed."
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse, a lot of randomness, Collector, puzzle
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Test precision clicking as more and more of the game screen becomes dangerous to click on.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want them to have a level of confidence when few coins are in play, quickly degrading into panic as the hazards continue multiplying and their score grows ever higher.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The controls are extremely simple: use the mouse to click on coins as they fly across the playfield. Every time a coin is clicked on, it moves elsewhere and a new hazard appears. Clicking a hazard instantly ends the game and displays your score. Refresh the page to play again.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Patience and precision are the key strategies for playing this game effectively.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This is an abstract game, relying on easily recognizable shapes (coins = good) and colors (red = danger). There's no particular narrative to this game, but I made sure to make the gameplay fun and potentially addictive to make up for it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who want something simple, yet challenging should enjoy this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Sessions could theoretically go on forever, but at most a session should take 3-5 minutes.
</li>
