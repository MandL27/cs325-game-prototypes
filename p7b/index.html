<h2>Power Maze</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
While many bridge puzzle-type games exist, Power Maze adds a greater element of planning ahead by only allowing certain paths to be unlocked (and re-locked) from one side. Players are thus unable to move theoretically infinitely with a single bridge.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I implemented a semi-formal object definition to track room data, like which sides have doors and whether locks are accessible from that side.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
My biggest lesson from this prototype is that JS is an iffy-at-best language for OOP. In other languages (like C#), I could easily whip up a class for room data; however, here I used a more struct-like type that felt hacky at best. This may just be me being unfamiliar with JS, though.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>All graphics by me</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
While I was unable to add multiple levels, this iteration of Power Maze features a much larger (and harder!) maze introducing more advanced techniques.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use keys and locks (some one-sided, some dual-sided) to navigate through a small maze.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
As this prototype stands now, it represents a single level in the hypothetical finished game. It also covers many of the techniques I would want to introduce to players.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want this game to force players to think through the scenario before them. Like many puzzle games, Power Maze caters to mind-oriented gamers.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay is simple: use the arrow keys to move between rooms and WASD to insert or remove keys. The objective is to reach the checkered room in the corner opposite where you start.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Long-term planning and recognizing necessary conditions are the order of the day in Power Maze. Being able to think through a plan is the key to success.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This whole game is abstract with no real narrative component, though players are free to interpret it as a prison break or other type of escape scenario.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Puzzle fans who want a new take on bridge puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game should take no longer than five minutes to play.
</li>
