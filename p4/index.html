<h2>Drag Race 2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Unlike most other driving games, including top-down ones, Drag Race is controlled by moving the mouse pointer.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The controls are all indirect - the car accelerates and steers by itself, trying to reach your cursor. Moving the cursor is the only way to navigate the course.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
This prototype was surprisingly simple to make. Adding rigid, unmoving physics objects to Phaser was simpler than I expected, which should help me with more intricate games later.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets here were hand-drawn.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I iterated on a previous game made this semester, also called Drag Race. This version has a proper track instead of just an oval, as well as improved traction and the ability to left click to go faster at the cost of traction.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move your mouse to guide the car to victory.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Oasis
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Indirect, deterministic, Competitor, racing
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This was meant as an experiment to see how much fun "indirect" controls could be on a game focused on movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experiment with ways to position their cursor to get the car to do laps as fast as possible. The controls should feel novel, but easy to get used to.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The core mechanic is making an object move without any direct input. Though there's still no timer as of this iteration, there is now a proper track and increased traction.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Figuring out what cursor positions result in the tightest turns is the key learning point for playing Drag Race. On a track like this, cursor wiggling to keep the car on a straight line may work surprisingly well.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is relatively abstract, but is meant to represent a time-attack race. Future iterations may add other cars as competition. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is aimed at players who want a new spin on classic top-down racers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Completing three laps should take no longer than two minutes.
</li>
